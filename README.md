# UFOs
## Summary 
Dana asked that we render a webpage with a dynamic table to provide an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. In addition to the date, users can filter the dynamic table for the city, state, country, and shape to help narrow their results. 

## Results 
When a user firast comes to the webpage they will be met with this screen and an unfiltered table. 
A user can always return to the unfiltered table by removing inputs from the filter feilds or by clicking the navbar at the top which will reload the page.

Users can then input filters. Here is the result when filtered on date.

Users have the option to input onto one filter feild or multiple. Here is the result when filtering on both data and city.

If a user enters criteria in which no table data matches that criteria, the table will appear blank.
